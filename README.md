# Supervised Learning from Scratch ðŸ§ 

This repository contains implementations of core supervised machine learning algorithms built from scratch using Python and NumPy â€” without relying on libraries like Scikit-Learn.

## Algorithms Covered

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree (in progress)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (in progress)
- Naive Bayes (in progress)

## Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## How to Run
